# EEFRanking (Enhanced Ensemble Feature Ranking)
EEFRanking R package implements EEFR feature selection algorithm as an enhancement of the former EFR. 

# pEEFRanking (Enhanced Ensemble Feature Ranking)
pEEFRanking R package is a parallel processing enhancement of EEFRanking for EEFR feature selection algorithm implementation.

Objective: EEFR makes Feature Ranking and Feature Selection tasks easier for Data Mining (DM) developers in R. On a DM process, EEFR can be used as feature selection pre-process, before classification.
